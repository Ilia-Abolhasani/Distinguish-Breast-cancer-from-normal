# Distinguish Breast Cancer from Normal - Texlife Project

This repository contains the research project focused on identifying genomic alterations and differential gene expression patterns in breast cancer among Malays, Chinese, and Indians populations. The project utilizes statistical analysis techniques to determine up-regulated and down-regulated genes, highlighting significant distinctions between normal and breast cancer samples.

## Dataset

The project utilizes microarray data sets with the GSE number 15852, comprising 43 breast cancer samples and 43 normal samples.
